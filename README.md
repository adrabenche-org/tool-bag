 # What
Here you will find a set of tools that helps you to develop and tests. Som of them **are not intended to use in production**. It's only a sandbox not prepared for production.

So, use this if you don't want to fight against all the docs and long setups. 

## Where

|Folder|What it is|
|---|---|
|my-cardano-node|A `README.md ` file with a set if instructions to start a cardano node running inside a container|
|yacc-builder| This stand for `Yet another cardano cli builder`. This is a quickly way to build a cardano-cli; but you can choose the version of the cardano-cli.
